# ATS Improvement Project

## Description
This project aims to improve the accuracy of Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) in matching resumes with job descriptions. It addresses various limitations such as keyword variations, contextual understanding, incomplete information, and tool limitations.

So, I've decided to delve deeper into these limitations using Google Generative AI.

## My plan involves:
- Custom Keyword Extraction
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Keyword Mapping and Matching
- Feedback Mechanism
